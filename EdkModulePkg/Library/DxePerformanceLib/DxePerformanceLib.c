/**
  Attempts to retrieve a performance measurement log entry from the performance measurement log. 
  
  Attempts to retrieve the performance log entry specified by LogEntryKey.  If LogEntryKey is
  zero on entry, then an attempt is made to retrieve the first entry from the performance log,
  and the key for the second entry in the log is returned.  If the performance log is empty,
  then no entry is retrieved and zero is returned.  If LogEntryKey is not zero, then the performance
  log entry associated with LogEntryKey is retrieved, and the key for the next entry in the log is
  returned.  If LogEntryKey is the key for the last entry in the log, then the last log entry is
  retrieved and an implementation specific non-zero key value that specifies the end of the performance
  log is returned.  If LogEntryKey is equal this implementation specific non-zero key value, then no entry
  is retrieved and zero is returned.  In the cases where a performance log entry can be returned,
  the log entry is returned in Handle, Token, Module, StartTimeStamp, and EndTimeStamp.
  If LogEntryKey is not a valid log entry key for the performance measurement log, then ASSERT().
  If Handle is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Token is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Module is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If StartTimeStamp is NULL, then ASSERT().
